A basic discord bot that queries the status of my minecraft server and edits a discord message every 60 seconds with the server's current status. Built usind discord.py (coded in python), mcstatus to actually get the server's information, asyncio, json to store the message to edit on a one message per channel basis, and datetime to generate timestamps (unfortunately in my time zone, I don't think you can use the fancy discord timestamp markdown in embeds).
