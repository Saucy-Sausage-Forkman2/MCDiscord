A basic discord bot that queries the status of my home server. Built using discord.py, mcstatus to actually get the server's information, asyncio, json to store the message id to edit on a one message per channel basis, and datetime to generate timestamps (which are unfortunately displayed in my time zone, I don't think you can use the fancy discord timestamp markdown in embeds).
